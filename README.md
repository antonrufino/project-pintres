## Installing bower
Bower can be used (negotiable) for maintaining frontend dependencies. We won't always have an Internet connection so might as well have local copies of necessary libraries e.g. AngularJS, jQuery, etc.

```bash
sudo npm install bower -g
```

## Installing project dependencies
```bash
# This assumes you are in the root of the project folder.
npm install # Install stuff needed by backend
cd frontend
bower install # Install stuff needed by frontend
```
